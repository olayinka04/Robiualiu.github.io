									<h2>Hi, I am <br />
									ROBIU ALIU THE ANALYST</h2>
									<p>Versatile Data Analyst with experience collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions.
									Excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analyses, including SQL, Spreadsheets, Tableau, Python and R.
									Strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills, recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate – a rigorous, hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ROBIU.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My name is Robiu Aliu, a Nigeria data Analyst with a background in Agricultural Economics. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in (Agricultural Economics, Kwara State University, Malete). After graduating with a masters in Agricultural Economics from Kwara State University Malete and a year of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), I developed passion for data analyst after The use of Econometrics method in my thesis research, which lead my interest to data analytics and science. Specifically, my Master’s Thesis with the heavy use of econometrics models spiked my interest towards data analytics.</p>
								<p>After some serious self-reflection about my passions and interests, i began to reaserch about how to become a data science, i found that there are great resouces on Udemy, Cousera, EDX and many more Platforms on the internet, i began my journey with Udemy and youtube, trouble shoot many problems through stackoverflow, a great community with resource to find solutions to any tech problems, I always like to develop myself by either following an (online) course, by developing a new application or just asking a coworker about his/her development. I committed to learning everything I could about how to code for Data Analytics, Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine learning using the MOOC websites such as Cousera, Udemy 365 Data science and other available resourcesMore recently, I have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera. Currently, I am working Platinum Touch Technology Solutions as data Analyst. Getting insights out of data is something that I really like. </p>
								<p>Data analyst is something that attracts me a lot, I think it is because of my curiosity of data and all the possibilities that are available to gain insights from that data! You don't always have to use hardcore concepts like deep learning to achieve that, my experience is that some plots can already give a 'aha' moment. Data visualization and machine learning are some techniques that I am using to achieve this.I am a big open source believer since I think with sharing solutions we can achieve a lot more as a community. Therefore I prefer to use R and python for my daily work. I am available for short-term freelancing projects or on longer-term consulting contracts, I can support each step of the process to enable your organisation in making evidence-driven decisions or share insights with new audiences, all the way to impactful presentation of insights.</p>

									<h4><a href="" class="active">Why did you make this website?</a> </h4>
									<dd style="display: block;">
										I created and deployed this website on open source <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> server so that I could learn more about web app design, 
										Back-end development and Data Analytics. The future I will use this website as a nesting ground for web-based Data Analytics, Data engineering and Machine learning engineering. 
										Though I don't expect it to be anything more than a portfolio site, I strongly suspect that these skills will be crucial to technological development in the years to come.

									<h4><a href="">How long have you been practicing machine learning?</a></h4>
								<dd style="display: block;">
								<p>I discovered machine learning at the beginning of 2019 after graduating from Kwara State University, Malete. Since then, 
									I have immersed myself in data science communities on <a href="https://udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> and across the web.
								I have rich experience in building machine learning solutions for NLP tasks. I have built models to assist in sentiment analysis, demographic clustering, and topic modelling.</p>
							</header>
							<header>
								<h4><a href="">Do you have any experience working with databases?</a></h4>
							<dd style="display: block;">
							<p>I have hosted and deployed my own MySQL database with this website. I have a intermediate knowledge of SQL queries, and have had experience working with AWS and GCP database servers through SSH.
							By renting servers from DigitalOcean, GCP, and AWS I have been able to develop my own back end production environment. I believe that data scientists who can own every step of the ML lifecycle will be invaluable in the coming years..</p>

								<h4><a href="">Why are you interested in NLP / machine learning?</a></h4>
								</dt>
								<dd style="display: block;">
									<p>I am curious by nature. Machine learning and natural language processing are both excellent tools to understand the world better.
								Despite the hype over integrating AI into existing technologies, the implementation of machine learning (especially NLP) is still in its infancy. This field is the wildwest, and I want to work with the pioneers and innovators that create new and amazing things.</p>

									<h4><a href=""> What kind of work do you see yourself doing? </a></h4>
								</dt>
								<dd style="display: block;">
								<p>I am interested in building modular machine learning applications that can communicate with existing production systems. Position titles that do this work are not well defined. I describe my perfect future position to be a mix of data science, machine learning engineering, and devops. Essentially a machine learning specialist with the skills to deploy a model to production.</p>
